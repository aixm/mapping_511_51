AIXM 5.1 &lt;-> 5.1.1 Mapping Scripts
This repository makes available two XSLT files that may be used to convert an AIXM 5.1 data set into a valid AIXM 5.1.1 data set and vice-versa. Each script is offered "as is", under a BSD license (as indicated in the heading of each file). They are not aimed to be used in an operational environment, but only as a demonstration that the full forward-backward mapping betweeb AIXM 5.1 and AIXM 5.1.1 is possible.

Limitation: the scripts have been tested only with Saxon (HE – 9.6.0.5). They do not work with xalan because of lack of support for the “matches” function.
